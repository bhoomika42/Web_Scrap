As the ripples spread across the great blockchain pond, the much-anticipated DuckChain Airdrop story unfolds.

‚ÄúOur Ducks deserve treasures as bright as the morning sun!‚Äù This proclamation inspired us to create an airdrop that truly rewards effort, engagement, and dedication.

Ducks who dove into the DuckChain pond with determination, participated in events, and engaged with the community will soon reap the rewards of their hard work.

Let‚Äôs dive into the details:

We‚Äôre distributing rewards to:

Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre determining your airdrop rewards:

1. Total on-chain Star Consumption

*Dishonest farming or Bot farming will be excluded to ensure fair rewards for genuine participants.

2. Number of Friends Invited

3. Types and Quantities of Testnet NFTs

*Already taken the snapshot after the testnet event.

4. Duck Level (Determined by a certain ratio of DUCK Points and Eggs amount)

*Only Ducks Level 2 and above are eligible. Level 1 Ducks will not receive rewards.

5. AI DAO Genesis Members Amount

*Each AI DAO Genesis Member will receive initial $DUCK tokens, and will continuously earn token rewards through ongoing governance participation.

6. Eggs Earned via Staking

7. Bridging Event

8. Other on-chain Activities and Contributions

Each of these factors contributes to your overall score, with bonuses for high levels of participation and engagement.

To ensure fair and transparent distribution, the rewards will be calculated using:

1. Weighted scores: Core activities will carry more weight, while bonus activities provide multipliers to boost final allocations.

2. Category-specific adjustments: Dedicated rewards for on-chain participants, AI DAO Genesis Members, and testnet NFT holders ensure every community member has an opportunity to shine.

Notes: While we‚Äôve done everything possible to ensure fairness and inclusivity, adjustments may be made to prevent exploitation and reward genuine participation. Rest assured, any changes will be communicated clearly and will prioritize the efforts of our loyal Ducks.

Stay Tuned, Ducks!

Your hard work and dedication are about to pay off.

Together, we‚Äôll make waves across the blockchain pond, setting new milestones for the DuckChain ecosystem. The future is bright, and your well-deserved rewards are just around the corner! ü¶Üüíõ
